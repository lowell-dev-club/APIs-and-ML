This is quick set of instructions on how to import a notebook to google collab to check our code or use it.

First you will want to open [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com)

Next copy this link https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/desi-python-intro/ and head back to Google Collab.

When you open to google collab it should look similar to this, if it doesn't try reloading the page to make the box pop up:

Switch to the Github tab and paste in the link (https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/desi-python-into/), after loading for a short bit your google collab should look like this:
![Google Collab loading github repo](https://github.com/lowell-dev-club/desi-python-intro/blob/main/collab-repo.png)

From there click on the .ipynb file that appears and it will open the Notebook for you to read, use, and test with!
